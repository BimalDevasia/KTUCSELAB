## Shell Scripting vs. Compiled Programming

* **Shell Scripting:**
    * Interpreted by the shell at runtime, line by line.
    * Easier to write and modify, but generally slower than compiled programs.
    * Good for automating tasks, system administration, and scripting.
* **Compiled Programming:**
    * Source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution.
    * Generally faster and more efficient than shell scripts.
    * More complex to develop and debug.
    * Used for building complex applications and system software.


## Shells in Linux

* **Bash (Bourne Again SHell):** Most popular shell, known for its ease of use and rich features.
* **Sh (Bourne Shell):** The original Unix shell, simpler and less feature-rich than Bash.
* **C Shell (csh):** Similar syntax to the C programming language, offers features like job control and aliases.
* **Z Shell (zsh):** Powerful shell with features like auto-completion, spelling correction, and plugins.

The main differences lie in syntax, features, and configuration options. Choose the shell that best suits your needs and preferences.


## Shell Script Comments

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored by the shell interpreter. Use comments to explain your code's functionality and improve readability.


## Shell Variables

* Variables store data that can be used throughout your script.
* Declare variables with a name followed by an `=` sign and the value.
* Access variable values using `$` followed by the variable name (e.g., `$name`).


## Shell Scripting Operators

* **Arithmetic Operators:** Perform mathematical operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
* **Comparison Operators:** Compare values (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`).
* **Logical Operators:** Combine conditions (e.g., `&&` for AND, `||` for OR).
* **String Operators:** Manipulate text strings (e.g., concatenation with `+`).


## Conditional Branching (if-else)

* Use `if` statements to execute code blocks conditionally based on a condition.
* Optional `else` block allows executing code if the condition is false.


## Loops (for, while)

* **for loops:** Iterate over a sequence of items (e.g., files in a directory).
* **while loops:** Execute code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.


## Reading User Input

* Use the `read` command to prompt the user for input and store it in a variable.


## Command-Line Arguments

* Arguments passed to the script when executed can be accessed using positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.).


## Shell Script Functions

* Define functions to group reusable blocks of code.
* Functions can take arguments and return values.


## Dining Philosophers Problem

* **Scenario:** Five philosophers sit around a circular table with one chopstick each. They can only eat with two chopsticks, one in each hand. However, only one chopstick is available between each pair of philosophers.
* **Challenge:**  The philosophers need to avoid deadlocks where everyone is waiting for the other to finish eating.
* **Synchronization Techniques:**
    * **Semaphores:** Control access to the chopsticks to ensure only one philosopher can pick up two at a time.
    * **Monitors:** A shared object that encapsulates the chopsticks and enforces synchronization rules.
* **Importance of Synchronization:**  Prevents race conditions and deadlocks when multiple processes or threads access shared resources concurrently.


## ACID Properties of Transactions

* **Atomicity:** A transaction is an indivisible unit of work. Either all actions succeed (commit), or none do (rollback).
* **Consistency:** Ensures the database transitions from one valid state to another.
* **Isolation:** Guarantees that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other's data.
* **Durability:** Ensures that committed transactions persist even in case of system failures.


## Transaction Stages

* **Start:** Transaction begins and acquires necessary resources (locks).
* **Commit:** Makes changes permanent in the database.
* **Rollback:** Undoes all changes made during the transaction if an error occurs.


## Concurrency Control

* Mechanisms like locking ensure that only one transaction can modify data at a time, preventing inconsistencies.
* Locking can be implemented at different granularities (e.g., row-level locking, table-level locking).


## Locking in Transactions

* A transaction can acquire locks on data items to prevent other transactions from modifying them.
* Read locks allow reading but not writing data.
* Write locks prevent both reading and writing by other transactions.


## System Calls

* **Interface:** Provide a way for user-level programs to request services from the operating system kernel.
  ## System Calls (Continued)

* **Differences from User-Level Functions:**
    * System calls require switching to kernel mode (privileged) for security reasons.
    * User-level functions operate within the user program's address space.
* **Examples of System Calls in Linux:**
    * `open()`: Opens a file.
    * `read()`: Reads data from a file.
    * `write()`: Writes data to a file.
    * `fork()`: Creates a new process.
    * `execve()`: Executes a program.
* **Kernel Role:**
    * Validates system call requests.
    * Performs the requested operation using kernel resources (e.g., accessing hardware).
    * Returns control to the user program.
* **Security Implications:**
    * System calls grant programs access to privileged resources.
    * Malicious code exploiting system calls can compromise system security.


## Semaphores (Signal and Wait)

* **Semaphores:** Synchronization objects that control access to shared resources.
* **Process Synchronization:**
    * A semaphore can be used as a counter to ensure only a certain number of processes can access a resource at a time.
* **Binary Semaphore:**
    * Value can only be 0 or 1.
    * 0: Resource is busy.
    * 1: Resource is available.
* **Counting Semaphore:**
    * Value can be any non-negative integer.
    * Represents the number of available resources.
* **`semwait()`:** Decrements the semaphore value. Blocks if the value is 0 (no resources available).
* **`sempost()`:** Increments the semaphore value. Signals processes waiting on the semaphore (if any).
* **Producer-Consumer Problem:**
    * Illustrates the need for synchronization between processes producing and consuming data.
    * Semaphores can ensure the producer doesn't overflow a buffer while the consumer is slow.


### shmat (POSIX): Shared Memory Attach - This function attaches a shared memory segment to the calling process's address space.
### shctl (POSIX): Shared Memory Control - This function performs various control operations on shared memory segments.
### shmdt (POSIX): Shared Memory Detach - This function detaches a shared memory segment from the calling process's address space.
### gethost (various OS): Get Host Information - This function retrieves information about a host computer based on its name or IP address.  


**Process Management:**

* **fork()**: This call creates a new process that is a nearly identical copy of the calling process. Both processes will continue execution after the call, inheriting the same memory space (initially), file descriptors, and other attributes. 
* **exec** family (e.g., `execv`, `execlp`): These calls replace the current process image with a new program. The specified program is loaded into memory, and execution starts from its entry point. After a successful `exec` call, the original process is essentially replaced by the new program.
* **getpid()**: This call retrieves the process ID (PID) of the calling process. The PID is a unique identifier used by the operating system to manage processes.
* **wait()**: This call waits for a child process to terminate. It can optionally return information about the child process's exit status. 
* **exit()**: This call terminates the calling process. The system cleans up resources associated with the process and returns an exit status code to the parent process (if any) that might be waiting with `wait()`.

**File System:**

* **open()**: This call opens a file and returns a file descriptor. The file descriptor is a small integer used in subsequent system calls to interact with the opened file. 
* **close()**: This call closes a previously opened file descriptor, releasing the associated resources.

**Directory Management:**

* **opendir()**: This call opens a directory for reading and returns a directory stream pointer. This pointer is used for subsequent calls to read directory entries.
* **readdir()**: This call reads the next entry from a directory stream opened by `opendir()`. It returns a pointer to a `dirent` structure containing information about the directory entry (e.g., filename, file type).

**Here's a breakdown of how these calls can be used together:**

1. A process can use `fork()` to create a child process.
2. The child process can use `exec` to load a new program and replace itself.
3. The parent process can use `getpid()` to get its own PID for identification purposes.
4. The parent process can use `wait()` to wait for the child process to finish execution.
5. A process can use `open()` to open a file for reading or writing.
6. It can then use `read()` or `write()` to interact with the opened file.
7. When finished, the process can use `close()` to release the file descriptor.
8. To read directory contents, a process can use `opendir()` to open a directory stream.
9. It can then use `readdir()` in a loop to iterate through each directory entry, retrieving information about the files and subdirectories.
