# Viva Question Answer Guide

## IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
IPC is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate and synchronize their actions. It can be achieved through various methods such as pipes, message queues, semaphores, shared memory, and sockets.

## MFOR
MFOR typically stands for Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling, a scheduling algorithm in operating systems that allows processes to move between different priority queues based on their behavior and aging.

## Types of Operating Systems(repeated question)

| Operating System Type          | Description                                                                                        | Example                   |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| *Batch Operating System*     | Executes batches of jobs without user interaction.                                                 | IBM OS/360                |
| *Time-Sharing Operating System* | Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.                                   | UNIX                      |
| *Distributed Operating System* | Manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer.               | Amoeba, Plan 9            |
| *Network Operating System*   | Provides services to computers connected to a network.                                             | Windows Server, Linux     |
| *Real-Time Operating System* | Responds to input immediately and is used in environments that require real-time processing.       | VxWorks, RTLinux          |

## System Goal
The primary goal of a system is to manage the hardware and software resources of the computer system, providing a stable, consistent environment for applications to run.

## SHM (Shared Memory)
Shared memory is a memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple programs with an intent to provide communication among them or avoid redundant copies.

## Logical Address and Physical Address
- *Logical Address*: The address generated by the CPU during program execution.
- *Physical Address*: The address actually available on the memory unit.

## Frames and Pages
- *Frames*: Fixed-size blocks of physical memory.
- *Pages*: Fixed-size blocks of logical memory (or virtual memory).

## Shared Memory
Shared memory allows multiple processes to access a common memory space. It is typically faster than other IPC methods.

### User-Defined Shared Memory
Users can define shared memory using system calls like shmget(), shmat(), and shmdt() in Unix/Linux systems.

## Multi-Processing vs Multi-Tasking System
- *Multi-Processing*: Involves multiple CPUs within a single system executing multiple processes simultaneously.
- *Multi-Tasking*: Allows multiple tasks or processes to be performed concurrently on a single CPU by rapidly switching between them.

## Disk Scheduling and CPU Scheduling

| Aspect                | CPU Scheduling                               | Disk Scheduling                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| *Purpose*           | Allocates CPU to processes                   | Manages the order of disk I/O requests           |
| *Algorithms*        | FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin, Multilevel | FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK           |
| *Focus*             | Process execution                            | Disk read/write efficiency                       |
| *Queue Type*        | Ready queue                                  | Disk queue                                       |
| *Criteria*          | Process waiting time, turnaround time        | Seek time, latency, throughput                   |

## Paging and Segmentation
- *Paging*: Divides the process's virtual address space into fixed-size pages.
- *Segmentation*: Divides the process's virtual address space into variable-sized segments.

## Types of Disk and CPU Scheduling
### Disk Scheduling Algorithms
1. *FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)*
2. *SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)*
3. *SCAN*
4. *C-SCAN*
5. *LOOK*
6. *C-LOOK*

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
1. *FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)*
2. *SJF (Shortest Job First)*
3. *Priority Scheduling*
4. *Round Robin*
5. *Multilevel Queue Scheduling*
6. *Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling*

## Fork in a Program
Using fork() in a program creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is called the child process.

### Difference in Output
The parent and child processes will execute concurrently. The child process will have a different Process ID (PID) from the parent. The output depends on how the processes are coded to interact or print.

## Batch System
A batch system collects jobs in a batch and processes them together without manual intervention.

## Thread
A thread is the smallest unit of processing. Threads within the same process share the same data space but can execute independently.

## Cache Memory
Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located close to the CPU that stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing.

### Types of Cache Memory
1. *L1 Cache*: Located on the CPU chip, very fast but small in size.
2. *L2 Cache*: Larger than L1, can be located on the CPU chip or a separate chip close to the CPU.
