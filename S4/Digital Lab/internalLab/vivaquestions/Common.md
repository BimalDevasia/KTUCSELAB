### Difference between combinational and sequential circuit:
Combinational Circuit: These circuits have outputs that depend only on the current input signals. They don't have any memory elements, so their outputs are solely determined by the present inputs.
Sequential Circuit: These circuits have memory elements (like flip-flops) which allow them to store information. The outputs depend not only on the present input but also on the past sequence of inputs. They have a feedback path which allows them to exhibit "memory" or sequential behavior.
### what is Flip-flop:
It's a fundamental building block of digital electronics. It stores a single bit of data, capable of holding either a 0 or a 1 state.
### Difference between flip-flop and latch:
Both flip-flops and latches are digital circuits used for storing binary data.
Flip-flop: It changes state either on the rising or falling edge of the clock signal. It has two stable states (0 or 1).
Latch: It changes state whenever the input changes, based on the control signal. It's level-triggered, meaning it's sensitive to the input level.
### Which counter is faster, synchronous or asynchronous?
Generally, synchronous counters are faster because all flip-flops in a synchronous counter are triggered by the same clock signal, ensuring that they change states simultaneously.
### Why synchronous design is difficult:
Synchronous design requires careful consideration of timing constraints, clock distribution, and synchronization techniques to ensure that signals arrive at the right time. Failure to meet these constraints can result in timing hazards like setup and hold time violations, which can lead to incorrect operation of the circuit.
### Another name for asynchronous counter:
Asynchronous counters are also known as ripple counters because the output of each flip-flop ripples through to trigger the next flip-flop.
### What does "mod" indicate?
"Mod" stands for modulus, which indicates the number of states in a counter. For example, a modulo-8 counter has 8 states (0 to 7).

### How many bits can one flip-flop count?
One flip-flop can store one bit of information, so it can count up to 2^1 = 2 different states (0 and 1).

 ### how many state does a 4 bit ring counter have vs 4 bit ripple counter
