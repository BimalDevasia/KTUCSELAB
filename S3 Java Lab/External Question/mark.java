/*We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects 
(each out of 100)
 by student B Create an abstract class 
 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPer
 centage' It is inherited by two other 
 classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method
  with the same name which returns the
   percentage of the students.
    The constructor of student A takes
     the marks in three subjects as its paramete
     rs and the marks in f
our subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the percentage of 
marks for both the students
